# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphone-Sensors

In the proposed system we have taken a data set for analyzation of six activities sitting, standing, walking, lying, climbing upstairs or downstairs. The dataset is first cleaned and all the null values are removed from
the dataset. Then it is split into training and testing.After that scaling is performed and 3 techniques are applied to the dataset: RandomForest ,Neural
Networks and KNN.We will obtain the confusion matrix for three of these classification techniques and the one with the most accurate result will be selected.
This system will use the sensors of the Android Smartphone such as accelerometer, Proximity Sensor,Heart Rate monitor, Fingerprint Scanner, Iris Scanner,
etc. It can be used by various healthcare organizations and can be benefitted as it can improve the health of human beings.It will be used to categorize the basic
human activities.
